GEGELATI _\[dʒedʒelati\]_ is a fresh open-source reinforcement learning framework for training artificial intelligence based on [Tangled Program Graphs (TPGs)](http://stephenkelly.ca/research_files/Kelly-Stephen-PhD-CSCI-June-2018.pdf). The purpose of this framework, developed as a C++ shared library, is to make it as easy and as fast as possible and to train an agent on a new learning environment. The C++ library is developed to be portable, fully documented, and thoroughly unit tested to ensure its maintainability. GEGELATI is developed at the Institut d'Electronique et des Technologies du numéRique (IETR).
